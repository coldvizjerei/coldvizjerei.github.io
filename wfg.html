            <li>Create an account</li>
            <li>Register for an examination</li>
            <ul>Use the following info:
                <li>Organization: Government/State Licensing Agencies</li>
                <li>Jurisdiction: New Jersey</li>
                <li>Account: NJ Life Producer (or NJ Accident and Health Producer)</li>
                <li>School/Provider: ExamFX</li>
            </ul>

            <li>General Tips/Notes</li>
            <ul>
                <li>ExamFx is an online study sitel once you sign up, you have a 3 month
                time window for you to study and pass the online exam to get the prelicensing 
                certificate</li>
                <li>You will pass the online test (and the real test) if you score 70% or above.
                Therefore, once you are scoring consistently above 80%, you should be ready to
                take the real thing!</li>
                <li>All questions are multiple choice. It's recommended to take the end of 
                chapter and practice quizzes repeatedly to familiarize yourself and understand
                the test questions/answers. (Quizzing helps retain knowledge + its also less
                boring!)</li>
                <li>You can pick your test date before you finish obtaining the certificate of
                completion. As long as you get the certificate in time for the test, it's all 
                good!</li>
                <li>Study for and pass the life exam first, then the accident and health one
                next!</li>
            </ul>
